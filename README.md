# Sudoku_Solver
Using backtracking algorithm and recursive function, this program is able to solve a 9x9 sudoku board

There are 3 solutions, two of them are very similar with slight variations in output, with the third one not being mine but its brevity caught my eye.

This mini-project is to strengthen my python skills and knowledge whilst completing online challenges such as the ones on hackerrank, codewars, and projecteuler.net.
